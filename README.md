This was a university project in which my teammates and I were tasked to create a search agent that would be able to solve a search problem using the following search algorithms:
Breadth first search
Depth first search
Uniform Cost search
Iterative Deepening search
Greedy search with two different heuristic functions
A* search with two different heuristic functions
